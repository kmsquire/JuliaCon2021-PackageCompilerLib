# `PackageCompiler.jl`

- Initially used to create custom system images (sysimages)
  - Precompile common libraries/code
- Can create relocatable "app bundles"
  - These are "just" Julia
    - ... plus artifacts
    - ... where the REPL entrypoint (`main`) has been replaced
    - ... built/bundled in a way that is relocatable
