# JuliaCon talks on Creating Libraries with PackageCompiler.jl

The slides can be viewed as a slide show using the 
["Slides" extension for VSCode.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nicoespeon.slides)

For proper viewing, you'll need the [JuliaMono](https://juliamono.netlify.app/) font installed on your system.

After installing the above:
* Restart VSCode inside of the directory you want to present (the slides need to be at the top level)
* Use Ctrl-Alt-P (⌘-⌥-P on Mac) to toggle Slides mode.
