# Limitations

- C-compatible types in the exposed interface
- Can only initialize and call Julia from a single thread in target language
  - Multiple threads within Julia are fine
- No support (yet) for installing multiple Julia-based C libraries
  - Workaround: create a Julia package which pulls in other Julia dependencies
- Not a lightweight solution
